    <p>Hello! My name is Alex Osei Sarpong, and I proudly come from the vibrant town of Techiman, Ghana. I have a deep passion for technology, especially in the areas of coding and design. From a young age, Iâ€™ve always been curious about how websites and applications work, which led me to pursue web development. I enjoy creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites that solve real-world problems and make peopleâ€™s lives easier.

In addition to coding, Iâ€™m constantly exploring new tools and techniques to improve my skillsâ€”whether it's learning modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks or understanding how to build responsive and accessible web pages. I find great satisfaction in turning ideas into functional digital experiences.

My goal is to become a professional software developer who not only writes clean and efficient code but also contributes to meaningful projects that have a positive impact. Iâ€™m excited about the future and the opportunities the tech industry offers, and Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and growth on this journey.</p>
